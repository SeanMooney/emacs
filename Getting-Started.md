## Keybinding Design Philosophy

### **1. Mnemonic Consistency**
- **First letter matches category**: `C-c g` = GPT, `C-c s` = Spell, `C-c t` = Terminal
- **Logical secondary letters**: `C-c g e` = GPT Explain, `C-c s c` = Spell Correct
- **Easy to remember**: Natural language associations

### **2. Frequency-Based Placement**
- **Single letters**: High-frequency actions (`C-c o` for focus mode)
- **Two letters**: Specific functions (`C-c g i` for improve writing)
- **Three letters**: Specialized operations (`C-c l f f` for format file)

### **3. Conflict Avoidance**
- **Uses C-c prefix extensively** (reserved for users in Emacs)
- **Careful C-x extensions** without breaking existing workflows
- **Strategic overrides** only when significantly better

### **4. Contextual Grouping**
- **AI functions**: All under `C-c g` prefix
- **Spell checking**: All under `C-c s` prefix
- **Terminals**: All under `C-c t` prefix
- **Project operations**: All under `C-x p` prefix

### **5. Accessibility Features**
- **Which-key integration**: Shows available options after prefix
- **Consistent patterns**: Reduces memorization burden
- **Visual mnemonics**: Letters match function names

### **Notable Enhancements to Emacs Defaults**

#### **Improved but Familiar**
- `C-f` → Consult line search (much better than forward-char)
- `C-j` → Consult imenu (more useful than newline-and-indent)
- `C-x b` → Consult buffer (enhanced buffer switching)

#### **Preserved Muscle Memory**
- `C-x C-f` → Find file (unchanged)
- `C-x C-s` → Save file (unchanged)
- Most fundamental Emacs bindings remain intact

#### **Smart Additions**
- `C-/` → Smart comment function (better than basic undo)
- Multiple cursor system for modern editing
- AI integration with logical keybindings

## Learning Strategy

### **Start with These Core Bindings**
1. **Navigation**: `C-f`, `C-x b`, `C-j`
2. **AI assistance**: `C-c g i`, `C-c g e`
3. **Project work**: `C-x p p`, `C-x p f`
4. **Focus**: `C-c o`, `C-c f`

### **Build Up Gradually**
- **Learn one prefix at a time** (start with `C-c g` for AI)
- **Use which-key** - it shows options after you press a prefix
- **Practice the mnemonics** - they become natural quickly

### **Advanced Features**
- **Multiple cursors** for bulk editing
- **Advanced search** with Consult integration
- **Specialized tools** like ranger file browser

### Understanding the Architecture

### Literate Programming Approach
- **Edit `lit.org`**, not `init.el` directly
- **Automatic tangling** - changes save to `init.el` automatically
- **Documentation with code** - explanations live alongside configuration
- **Easy customization** - find what you want to change and modify it

### Package Management
- **straight.el** manages packages directly from Git
- **use-package** provides clean, declarative configuration
- **No package conflicts** - reproducible setup across machines

### Keybinding Organization
All custom keybindings use consistent prefixes:
- `C-c g` - All AI functions (code and writing)
- `C-c s` - Spell checking and language tools
- `C-c t` - Terminal and shell commands
- `C-c a` - Claude Code integration
- `C-x p` - Project management
- `C-x r` - File browser functions

### Development Workflow Reference

### Starting a Project
1. **Navigate to project**: `C-x p p` (project switch)
2. **Find files quickly**: `C-x p f` (project find file)
3. **Search across project**: `M-s r` (ripgrep search)
4. **Open project terminal**: `C-c t p`

### Code Understanding
1. **Select unfamiliar code**
2. **Press `C-c g e`** for AI explanation
3. **Use `C-c g r`** for improvement suggestions
4. **Jump to definitions** with LSP (automatic in most languages)

### Version Control
- **Git status**: `C-x g` (opens Magit)
- **See changes visually** - diff indicators appear in the fringe
- **Stage and commit** through Magit interface

### Configuration Validation (Optional but Recommended)
To prevent Emacs configuration syntax errors:

```bash
# One-time setup
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This automatically validates your configuration before commits, preventing syntax errors that could break Emacs startup.

### Writing Workflow Reference

### Setting Up for Writing
1. **Open your document** (Markdown, text, or Org file)
2. **Enable focus mode**: `C-c o` (Olivetti)
3. **Switch to writing font**: `C-c f` → choose appropriate preset
4. **Notice live word count** in the mode line: `WC[words,chars,lines]`

### AI-Enhanced Writing Process
1. **Draft your content** normally
2. **Select paragraphs** and use:
   - `C-c g i` - Improve clarity and grammar
   - `C-c g t` - Adjust tone for audience
   - `C-c g s` - Create summaries
   - `C-c g p` - Comprehensive proofreading

### Spell Checking & Grammar
- **Automatic spell check** with traditional Flyspell
- **Quick corrections**: `M-$` on misspelled words
- **Grammar analysis** automatic with writegood-mode
- **Advanced spell options**: `C-c s` prefix commands

### Accessibility Features Reference

This configuration is designed with accessibility in mind:

### For Dyslexic Users
- **OpenDyslexic font preset** available via `C-c f`
- **Enhanced visual feedback** for spelling errors
- **Pulsar mode** highlights cursor movement
- **Clear color coding** throughout interface

### For All Users
- **Consistent keybindings** with logical prefixes
- **Helpful mode** shows better documentation
- **Which-key** displays available commands
- **Rich completion** with context and previews

### Advanced Customization Reference

### Adding Your Own Functions
Edit `lit.org` and add functions in the "Custom Commands & Bindings" section. The configuration will automatically reload when you save.

### Changing Keybindings
Find the relevant section in `lit.org` and modify the `:bind` declarations in use-package blocks.

### Adding Packages
Use the `use-package` format following existing patterns. The configuration uses `straight.el` so packages come directly from Git repositories.

### AI Configuration
The AI functions connect to your local Ollama instance. Modify the `gptel` configuration in `lit.org` to change models or endpoints.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### **Installation Issues**
- **"Package not found" errors**: Run `M-x straight-pull-all` then `M-x straight-rebuild-all`
- **Slow first startup**: Normal - packages are installing (2-3 minutes)
- **Font issues**: Install Source Code Pro or choose different preset with `C-c f`
- **Native compilation warnings**: Normal - they'll disappear after packages compile

### **Configuration Issues**
- **Changes don't take effect**: Edit `lit.org`, not `init.el`. Save to auto-tangle
- **Keybinding doesn't work**: Use `C-h k` then press key to see what it's bound to
- **Package seems broken**: Try `M-x straight-rebuild-package` then restart Emacs

### **Performance Issues**
- **Slow startup**: Check `*Messages*` buffer for errors, consider removing unused packages
- **High memory usage**: Normal for rich features, but restart Emacs if it gets excessive
- **Laggy typing**: Disable some visual features temporarily, check for runaway processes

### **AI & External Tool Issues**
- **AI functions not working**: Verify Ollama running at `192.168.16.172:11434`
- **Spell check not working**: Install `aspell` or `hunspell` system packages
- **LSP not starting**: Install language server for your language (e.g., `pip install pyright`)
- **Search not working**: Install `ripgrep` (`rg` command)

### **Getting Help**
- **Immediate help**: `C-h k` (what does this key do?) or `C-h f` (what does this function do?)
- **Available commands**: `M-x` then type to search all commands
- **Package documentation**: `C-h P` then type package name
- **Configuration docs**: Read `lit.org` - it's designed to be human-readable

### **When Things Break**
1. **Stay calm**: `C-g` cancels any stuck command
2. **Check messages**: `C-x b *Messages*` for error details
3. **Restart if needed**: `C-c x r` (restart Emacs)
4. **Restore backup**: If all else fails, restore your backup configuration

### **Reset Nuclear Option**
If configuration is completely broken:
```bash
mv ~/.config/emacs ~/.config/emacs-broken
git clone [repo-url] ~/.config/emacs
```

## Customization & Next Steps

### **Safe Customization**
- **Always edit `lit.org`** (never edit `init.el` directly)
- **Test changes incrementally** (save `lit.org` after small changes)
- **Use version control** (`git add` and `git commit` your changes)
- **Keep backups** of working configurations

### **Common Customizations**
- **Add keybindings**: Find similar bindings in `lit.org` and copy the pattern
- **Change fonts**: Edit the fontaine presets section
- **Add packages**: Follow existing `use-package` patterns
- **Modify AI prompts**: Edit the AI function definitions
